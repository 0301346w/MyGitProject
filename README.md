**Coding problem:**

The two problems to code were:
1.	A Python code that takes the radius as input from the user and prints the circles area, volume, and circumference.
2.	A Python code that takes a list of number as input from the user and prints their sum, average and the highest number.

**Responsibilities:**

Shadid Hasan â€“ Make the area function of the circle.py and the sum function of the BasicStats.py. Make the repository and upload the files and do pull requests and merge.
Michael Warford - Make the circumference function of the circle.py and the average function of the BasicStats.py. Make a fork and commit the changes.
Zeid Zeid - Make the volume function of the circle.py and the max function of the BasicStats.py. Make a fork and commit the changes.

**Collaborative Worksteps completed:**

Shadid created MyGitProject repository and coded the circle.py and BasicStats.py and added the area and sum function in those and uploaded the files in the repository. From settings collaborator, Michael and Zeid were added to the repository. Michael made a fork of the repository and made changes to both codes adding circumference function of the circle.py and the average function of the BasicStats.py and committed the changes. Zeid did the same as he made a fork of the repository and made changes to both codes adding volume function of the circle.py and the max function of the BasicStats.py and committed the changes. Afterwards, Shadid checked all the changes with a pull request and made sure the codes can be merged. A merge was conducted. Lastly, the ReadMe file was updated.
